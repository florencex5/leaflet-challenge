# Leaflet-Challenge

## Task
* Create the Earthquake Visualization by using Leaflet
* Get the dataset(JSON format) from the United States Geological Survey website
* Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization

## Content
* Use `L.geoJSON` to create a GeoJSON layer(for collecting earthquake data) on the map
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
* A legend was created to represent the level of earthquake's depth
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked

## Credits
* My Tutor: Mark Fullton
